## 10 Must-Know Spanish Grammar Points for Beginners

- Noun gender: Every noun in Spanish is either masculine or feminine. 
- Article agreement: The articles "el" (the), "la" (the), "los" (the), and "las" (the) must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. 
- Verb conjugation: Verbs change form depending on the subject of the sentence (who is performing the action). 
- Subject pronouns: Words like "yo" (I), "tú" (you), "él" (he) indicate who is performing the action. 
- Adjective agreement: Adjectives must also agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. 
- Basic word order: Sentences typically follow the structure of subject - verb - object. 
- Direct object pronouns: Words like "lo" (him/it), "la" (her/it) replace a noun to avoid repetition. 
- Negation: To make a sentence negative, use the word "no" before the verb. 
- Question formation: To form a question, usually invert the subject and verb or add "whether" words. 
- "Ser" vs. "estar": "Ser" describes inherent qualities or states of being, while "estar" describes temporary states or locations.
